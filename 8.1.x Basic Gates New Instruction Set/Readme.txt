8 Bits CPU
This the first 8 bit machine, ram is still done in a single chip.

New instruction set, that will be expanded.
It comes with 2 test progamm written in the cpu asm:
-Sum1000 sums the first 1000 integers and saves the result in memory
-Nprime finds the first 4 prime numbers

To run the simulation:
open logisim
open the .circ file 4.0.1...
find the ram chip on the far right
right click and "load image" of Nprime or Sum1000

In logisim "Simulate" menu, select "Ticks enable" and a frequency.
In the top left of the circuit click the "ON" light green button.
(you may have to hold it for a bit if you select a very slow frequecy like 1Hz)
